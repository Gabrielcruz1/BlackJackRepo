BLACKJACK -  Blackjack, or twenty-one, Card game whose object is to be dealt cards having a higher count than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21. The dealer may use a single deck of 52 cards or two or more decks from a holder called a shoe. Aces count as 1 or 11, and face cards as 10.

Wire frame: Pen and paper sketch.

Next steps: My future enhancements include adding card images to the game so that it is more visually appealing. I plan on enhancing functionality of all buttons on when they can and can not be clicked upon. I plan on enhancing the game as a whole as I will keep this a live project for future employers.
