Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

Getting started: https://github.com/Gabrielcruz1/BlackJackRepo.git

Next steps: My future enhancements include adding card images to the game so that it is more visually appealing. I plan on enhancing functionality of all buttons on when they can and can not be clicked upon. I plan on enhancing the game as a whole as I will keep this a live project for future employers.
